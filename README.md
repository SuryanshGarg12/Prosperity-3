## Round 1

### RAINFOREST_RESIN – Mean Reversion with Adaptive Quoting

Rainforest Resin was the simplest asset to trade since its price reliably oscillated around 10,000. We set initial thresholds to buy at ≤ 9,999 and sell at ≥ 10,001, then introduced a dynamic “edge” that, when orders at (9,999 buy, 10,001 sell) filled consistently, widened the band to buy at ≤ 9,998 and sell at ≥ 10,002, and, if fills became infrequent, narrowed it back to the original levels.

### KELP – Filtered Reversion Model

KELP followed a similar reversion idea, but with added filtering to avoid large (potentially toxic) orders. We calculated a fair price using filtered mid-prices and applied a basic reversion adjustment. The strategy had three parts: take good offers, clear risky positions, and place passive quotes near the fair value. This helped avoid bad fills and manage risk better.

### SQUID_INK – Oscillator-Based Entries with Trailing Exit

For SQUID_INK, we used a stochastic oscillator to find possible trend reversals. Entry signals were based on %K and %D crossovers with basic price confirmation. Once in a trade, we tracked the highest/lowest price and used a 5% trailing stop to exit. This kept trades simple and avoided holding through big reversals.

## ⚙️ Strategy Overview – Round 2

In Round 2, we continued using the same base logic for **RAINFOREST_RESIN**, **KELP**, and **SQUID_INK**, with slight improvements. The main focus was on extending the strategy to support newly introduced assets: **PICNIC_BASKET1**, **PICNIC_BASKET2**, **CROISSANTS**, **JAMS**, and **DJEMBES**.

### PICNIC_BASKET1 & PICNIC_BASKET2 – Basket Arbitrage with Component Hedging

We introduced a **basket arbitrage strategy** for PICNIC_BASKET1 and PICNIC_BASKET2. The idea was to compute a theoretical price for each basket based on its components (e.g., CROISSANTS, JAMS, DJEMBES) and compare it with the live market price.

- If the basket was overpriced, we sold it and bought the components.
- If it was underpriced, we bought the basket and sold the components.
- All trades were **hedged** using component legs to keep exposure balanced.
- A **dynamic threshold** was used to account for volatility and avoid false signals.

---

### CROISSANTS, JAMS, DJEMBES – Used Only for Hedging

These products were **not traded independently**. They were used exclusively for hedging the basket positions during arbitrage trades. Volumes were calculated based on the basket composition to neutralize exposure after a PICNIC_BASKET1 or 2 trade.

---

### Minor Adjustments

- **RAINFOREST_RESIN** and **KELP**: Slight tuning to edge widths and fair value smoothing.
- **SQUID_INK**: Refined reversion model and filtered price levels to reduce overtrading during noise.
