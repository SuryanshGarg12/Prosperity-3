## Round 1

### RAINFOREST_RESIN ‚Äì Mean Reversion with Adaptive Quoting

Rainforest Resin was the simplest asset to trade since its price reliably oscillated around‚ÄØ10,000. We set initial thresholds to buy at ‚â§‚ÄØ9,999 and sell at ‚â•‚ÄØ10,001, then introduced a dynamic ‚Äúedge‚Äù that, when orders at (9,999 buy,‚ÄØ10,001 sell) filled consistently, widened the band to buy at ‚â§‚ÄØ9,998 and sell at ‚â•‚ÄØ10,002, and, if fills became infrequent, narrowed it back to the original levels.

### KELP ‚Äì Filtered Reversion Model

KELP followed a similar reversion idea, but with added filtering to avoid large (potentially toxic) orders. We calculated a fair price using filtered mid-prices and applied a basic reversion adjustment. The strategy had three parts: take good offers, clear risky positions, and place passive quotes near the fair value. This helped avoid bad fills and manage risk better.

### SQUID_INK ‚Äì Oscillator-Based Entries with Trailing Exit

For SQUID_INK, we used a stochastic oscillator to find possible trend reversals. Entry signals were based on %K and %D crossovers with basic price confirmation. Once in a trade, we tracked the highest/lowest price and used a 5% trailing stop to exit. This kept trades simple and avoided holding through big reversals.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Strategy Overview ‚Äì Round 2

In Round 2, we continued using the same base logic for **RAINFOREST_RESIN**, **KELP**, and **SQUID_INK**, with slight improvements. The main focus was on extending the strategy to support newly introduced assets: **PICNIC_BASKET1**, **PICNIC_BASKET2**, **CROISSANTS**, **JAMS**, and **DJEMBES**.

---

### PICNIC_BASKET1 & PICNIC_BASKET2 ‚Äì Basket Arbitrage with Component Hedging

We introduced a **basket arbitrage strategy** for PICNIC_BASKET1 and PICNIC_BASKET2. The idea was to compute a theoretical price for each basket based on its components (e.g., CROISSANTS, JAMS, DJEMBES) and compare it with the live market price.

- If the basket was overpriced, we sold it and bought the components.
- If it was underpriced, we bought the basket and sold the components.
- All trades were **hedged** using component legs to keep exposure balanced.
- A **dynamic threshold** was used to account for volatility and avoid false signals.

---

### CROISSANTS, JAMS, DJEMBES ‚Äì Used Only for Hedging

These products were **not traded independently**. They were used exclusively for hedging the basket positions during arbitrage trades. Volumes were calculated based on the basket composition to neutralize exposure after a PICNIC_BASKET1 or 2 trade.

---

### Minor Adjustments

- **RAINFOREST_RESIN** and **KELP**: Slight tuning to edge widths and fair value smoothing.
- **SQUID_INK**: Refined reversion model and filtered price levels to reduce overtrading during noise.
