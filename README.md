## Round 1

### RAINFOREST_RESIN ‚Äì Mean Reversion with Adaptive Quoting

Rainforest Resin was the simplest asset to trade since its price reliably oscillated around‚ÄØ10,000. We set initial thresholds to buy at ‚â§‚ÄØ9,999 and sell at ‚â•‚ÄØ10,001, then introduced a dynamic ‚Äúedge‚Äù that, when orders at (9,999 buy,‚ÄØ10,001 sell) filled consistently, widened the band to buy at ‚â§‚ÄØ9,998 and sell at ‚â•‚ÄØ10,002, and, if fills became infrequent, narrowed it back to the original levels.


---

### KELP ‚Äì Filtered Reversion Model

KELP followed a similar reversion idea, but with added filtering to avoid large (potentially toxic) orders. We calculated a fair price using filtered mid-prices and applied a basic reversion adjustment. The strategy had three parts: take good offers, clear risky positions, and place passive quotes near the fair value. This helped avoid bad fills and manage risk better.

---

### SQUID_INK ‚Äì Oscillator-Based Entries with Trailing Exit

For SQUID_INK, we used a stochastic oscillator to find possible trend reversals. Entry signals were based on %K and %D crossovers with basic price confirmation. Once in a trade, we tracked the highest/lowest price and used a 5% trailing stop to exit. This kept trades simple and avoided holding through big reversals.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Strategy Overview ‚Äì Round 2

In Round 2, we continued using the same base logic for **RAINFOREST_RESIN**, **KELP**, and **SQUID_INK**, with slight improvements. The main focus was on extending the strategy to support newly introduced assets: **PICNIC_BASKET1**, **PICNIC_BASKET2**, **CROISSANTS**, **JAMS**, and **DJEMBES**.

---

### PICNIC_BASKET1 & PICNIC_BASKET2 ‚Äì Basket Arbitrage with Component Hedging

We introduced a **basket arbitrage strategy** for PICNIC_BASKET1 and PICNIC_BASKET2. The idea was to compute a theoretical price for each basket based on its components (e.g., CROISSANTS, JAMS, DJEMBES) and compare it with the live market price.

- If the basket was overpriced, we sold it and bought the components.
- If it was underpriced, we bought the basket and sold the components.
- All trades were **hedged** using component legs to keep exposure balanced.
- A **dynamic threshold** was used to account for volatility and avoid false signals.

---

### CROISSANTS, JAMS, DJEMBES ‚Äì Used Only for Hedging

These products were **not traded independently**. They were used exclusively for hedging the basket positions during arbitrage trades. Volumes were calculated based on the basket composition to neutralize exposure after a PICNIC_BASKET1 or 2 trade.

---

### Minor Adjustments

- **RAINFOREST_RESIN** and **KELP**: Slight tuning to edge widths and fair value smoothing.
- **SQUID_INK**: Refined reversion model and filtered price levels to reduce overtrading during noise.

---

## Round 3 ‚Äì Volatility and Vouchers

Round 3 added new dimensions to the trading landscape, notably with **VOLCANIC_ROCK** and its **VOUCHERS**. We expanded our system while preserving all previous strategies.

---

### VOLCANIC_ROCK ‚Äì Z-Score Mean Reversion

We implemented a **mean reversion strategy** using Z-score logic over a rolling 50-tick window:

- Computed rolling mean and standard deviation of mid-prices.
- If Z-score < -1.9, we entered a **long** position.
- If Z-score > +1.9, we entered a **short** position.
- Position sizing was controlled using current exposure vs. soft limits.

This approach profited from temporary overreactions in price while managing risk via thresholds.

---

### VOUCHERS ‚Äì Paired Mean Reversion by Strike

Each voucher (e.g., **VOUCHER_9500**, **VOUCHER_9750**, etc.) was handled using a **strike-specific threshold** for Z-score entry:

- When price deviated significantly (Z > threshold), a trade was executed in the **opposite direction** of the deviation.
- This strategy allowed for **directional bets** when mispricings occurred in relation to VOLCANIC_ROCK.

---

### Minor Enhancements

- Expanded inventory control and Z-score tracking.
- Added volatility-aware execution and smoothing on key indicators.
- Integrated minimal persistent state with `jsonpickle` to retain history during backtesting.

---

## Round 4 ‚Äì Volatility, Adaptation & Cross-Market Arbitrage

Round 4 significantly expanded our trading system, introducing **MAGNIFICENT_MACARONS**, **SUNLIGHT-based risk triggers**, and more robust **volatility-aware options strategies** on **VOLCANIC_ROCK VOUCHERS**.

---

### MAGNIFICENT_MACARONS ‚Äì Cross-Market Arbitrage with Adaptive Quoting

We developed a **cross-market arbitrage strategy** that used foreign market data and conversion costs to calculate **implied bid/ask prices**. Key innovations included:

- **Edge adaptation**: The quoting edge dynamically adjusted based on recent position volumes and market aggressiveness.
- **Aggressive unwinding**: If SUNLIGHT levels stayed below a critical threshold for multiple ticks, all MACARONS positions were aggressively cleared at market.
- **Filtered execution**: Only traded against favorable levels (filtered by size) to avoid adverse selection.

---

### VOLCANIC_ROCK VOUCHERS ‚Äì Dual Strategy Switching

We introduced two volatility-driven strategies for options:

1. **IV Momentum Strategy**:
   - Traded based on short vs. long EWMA IV crossover.
   - Positioned long/short depending on the directional IV trend.

2. **Arbitrage Strategy**:
   - Compared live mid-prices against Black-Scholes theoretical values with a dynamic buffer.
   - Executed trades when prices deviated from theory, sizing based on **vega** and **risk budget**.

A **meta-strategy** switched between the two based on recent profitability.

---

### SUNLIGHT Risk Filter

To manage **exogenous environmental risk**, we:

- Monitored SUNLIGHT index for MACARONS.
- If readings stayed below 45 for 10 consecutive ticks, we immediately exited MACARONS positions.
- Prevented new entries until SUNLIGHT normalized.

---

### Other Improvements

- **RAINFOREST_RESIN**: No changes ‚Äì base logic preserved.
- **KELP**: Improved quote filtering and smoother fair value adjustment.
- **PICNIC_BASKETS**: Enhanced dynamic thresholds and volume scaling for hedged arbitrage.
- **SQUID_INK**: Minor tuning of entry edges and reversion parameters.
- **JAMS**: New strategy using a stochastic oscillator to time reversion entries/exits.
